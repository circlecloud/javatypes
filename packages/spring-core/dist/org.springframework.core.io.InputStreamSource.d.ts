                 * <p>For single-use streams, {@link InputStreamResource} can be used for any
                 * given {@code InputStream}. Spring's {@link ByteArrayResource} or any

                 * instance, allowing one to read the underlying content stream multiple times.
                 * This makes this interface useful as an abstract content source for mail
                 * attachments, for example.
