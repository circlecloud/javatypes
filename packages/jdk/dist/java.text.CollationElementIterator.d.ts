         * The <code>CollationElementIterator</code> class is used as an iterator
         * to walk through each character of an international string. Use the iterator
         * to return the ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering
         * priority of a character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character
         * is collated in the given collation object.
         * <p>
         * For example, consider the following in Spanish:
         * <blockquote>
         * <pre>
         * "ca" &rarr; the first key is key('c') and second key is key('a').
         * "cha" &rarr; the first key is key('ch') and second key is key('a').
         * </pre>
         * </blockquote>
         * And in German,
         * <blockquote>
         * <pre>
         * "Ã¤b" &rarr; the first key is key('a'), the second key is key('e'), and
         * the third key is key('b').
         * </pre>
         * </blockquote>
         * The key of a character is an integer composed of primary order(short),
         * secondary order(byte), and tertiary order(byte). Java strictly defines
         * the size and signedness of its primitive data types. Therefore, the static
         * functions <code>primaryOrder</code>, <code>secondaryOrder</code>, and
         * <code>tertiaryOrder</code> return <code>int</code>, <code>short</code>,
         * and <code>short</code> respectively to ensure the correctness of the key
         * value.
         * <p>
         * Example of the iterator usage,
         * <blockquote>
         * <pre>
         * String testString = "This is a test";
         * Collator col = Collator.getInstance();
         * if (col instanceof RuleBasedCollator) {
         * RuleBasedCollator ruleBasedCollator = (RuleBasedCollator)col;
         * CollationElementIterator collationElementIterator = ruleBasedCollator.getCollationElementIterator(testString);
         * int primaryOrder = CollationElementIterator.primaryOrder(collationElementIterator.next());
         * :
         * }
         * </pre>
         * </blockquote>
         * <p>
         * <code>CollationElementIterator.next</code> returns the collation order
         * of the next character. A collation order consists of primary order,
         * secondary order and tertiary order. The data type of the collation
         * order is <strong>int</strong>. The first 16 bits of a collation order
         * is its primary order; the next 8 bits is the secondary order and the
         * last 8 bits is the tertiary order.
         * <p><b>Note:</b> <code>CollationElementIterator</code> is a part of
         * <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> implementation. It is only usable
         * with <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> instances.
