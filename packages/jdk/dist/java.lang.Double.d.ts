             * floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point
             * "double format" bit layout.
             * <p>If the argument is {@code 0x7ff0000000000000L}, the result
             * is positive infinity.
             * <p>If the argument is {@code 0xfff0000000000000L}, the result
             * is negative infinity.
             * <p>If the argument is any value in the range
             * {@code 0x7ff0000000000001L} through
             * {@code 0x7fffffffffffffffL} or in the range
             * {@code 0xfff0000000000001L} through
             * {@code 0xffffffffffffffffL}, the result is a NaN.  No IEEE
             * 754 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish
             * between two NaN values of the same type with different bit
             * patterns.  Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by
             * use of the {@code Double.doubleToRawLongBits} method.
             * <p>In all other cases, let <i>s</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>m</i> be three
             * values that can be computed from the argument:
             * <blockquote><pre>{@code
             * int s = ((bits >> 63) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
             * int e = (int)((bits >> 52) & 0x7ffL);
             * long m = (e == 0) ?
             * (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) << 1 :
             * (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) | 0x10000000000000L;
             * }</pre></blockquote>
             * Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical
             * expression <i>s</i>&middot;<i>m</i>&middot;2<sup><i>e</i>-1075</sup>.
             * <p>Note that this method may not be able to return a
             * {@code double} NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the
             * {@code long} argument.  IEEE 754 distinguishes between two
             * kinds of NaNs, quiet NaNs and <i>signaling NaNs</i>.  The
             * differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not
             * visible in Java.  Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn
             * them into quiet NaNs with a different, but often similar, bit
             * pattern.  However, on some processors merely copying a
             * signaling NaN also performs that conversion.  In particular,
             * copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method
             * may perform this conversion.  So {@code longBitsToDouble}
             * may not be able to return a {@code double} with a
             * signaling NaN bit pattern.  Consequently, for some
             * {@code long} values,
             * {@code doubleToRawLongBits(longBitsToDouble(start))} may
             * <i>not</i> equal {@code start}.  Moreover, which
             * particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform
             * dependent; although all NaN bit patterns, quiet or signaling,
             * must be in the NaN range identified above.
             * @param bits   any {#code long} integer.
             * @return the {#code double} floating-point value with the same
