         * The <code>Collator</code> class performs locale-sensitive
         * <code>String</code> comparison. You use this class to build
         * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
         * <p>
         * <code>Collator</code> is an abstract base class. Subclasses
         * implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
         * <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>, is currently provided with
         * the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
         * subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
         * <p>
         * Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
         * factory method, <code>getInstance</code>, to obtain the appropriate
         * <code>Collator</code> object for a given locale. You will only need
         * to look at the subclasses of <code>Collator</code> if you need
         * to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
         * if you need to modify that strategy.
         * <p>
         * The following example shows how to compare two strings using
         * the <code>Collator</code> for the default locale.
         * <blockquote>
         * <pre>{@code
         * // Compare two strings in the default locale
         * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
         * if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )
         * System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");
         * else
         * System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");
         * }</pre>
         * </blockquote>
         * <p>
         * You can set a <code>Collator</code>'s <em>strength</em> property
         * to determine the level of difference considered significant in
         * comparisons. Four strengths are provided: <code>PRIMARY</code>,
         * <code>SECONDARY</code>, <code>TERTIARY</code>, and <code>IDENTICAL</code>.
         * The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
         * locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered
         * primary differences, while "e" and "&#283;" are secondary differences,
         * "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical.
         * The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
         * US English.
         * <blockquote>
         * <pre>
         * //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
         * Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
         * usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
         * if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {
         * System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
         * }
         * </pre>
         * </blockquote>
         * <p>
         * For comparing <code>String</code>s exactly once, the <code>compare</code>
         * method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
         * <code>String</code>s however, it is generally necessary to compare each
         * <code>String</code> multiple times. In this case, <code>CollationKey</code>s
         * provide better performance. The <code>CollationKey</code> class converts
         * a <code>String</code> to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
         * against other <code>CollationKey</code>s. A <code>CollationKey</code> is
         * created by a <code>Collator</code> object for a given <code>String</code>.
         * <br>
         * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>CollationKey</code>s from different
         * <code>Collator</code>s can not be compared. See the class description
         * for {@link CollationKey}
         * for an example using <code>CollationKey</code>s.
