         * The class <code>Date</code> represents a specific instant
         * in time, with millisecond precision.
         * <p>
         * Prior to JDK&nbsp;1.1, the class <code>Date</code> had two additional
         * functions.  It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
         * minute, and second values.  It also allowed the formatting and parsing
         * of date strings.  Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not
         * amenable to internationalization.  As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the
         * <code>Calendar</code> class should be used to convert between dates and time
         * fields and the <code>DateFormat</code> class should be used to format and
         * parse date strings.
         * The corresponding methods in <code>Date</code> are deprecated.
         * <p>
         * Although the <code>Date</code> class is intended to reflect
         * coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly,
         * depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine.
         * Nearly all modern operating systems assume that 1&nbsp;day&nbsp;=
         * 24&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;60&nbsp;= 86400 seconds
         * in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there
         * is an extra second, called a "leap second." The leap
         * second is always added as the last second of the day, and always
         * on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the
         * year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
         * Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect
         * the leap-second distinction.
         * <p>
         * Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean
         * time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT).  GMT is
         * the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the
         * "scientific" name for the same standard. The
         * distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic
         * clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all
         * practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the
         * earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up
         * in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap
         * seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within
         * 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain
         * corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as
         * well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based
         * global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is
         * <i>not</i> adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source of
         * further information is the U.S. Naval Observatory, particularly
         * the Directorate of Time at:
         * <blockquote><pre>
         * <a href=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil>http://tycho.usno.navy.mil</a>
         * </pre></blockquote>
         * <p>
         * and their definitions of "Systems of Time" at:
         * <blockquote><pre>
         * <a href=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html>http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html</a>
         * </pre></blockquote>
         * <p>
         * In all methods of class <code>Date</code> that accept or return
         * year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the
         * following representations are used:
         * <ul>
         * <li>A year <i>y</i> is represented by the integer
         * <i>y</i>&nbsp;<code>-&nbsp;1900</code>.
         * <li>A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January,
         * 1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.
         * <li>A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31
         * in the usual manner.
         * <li>An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour
         * from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the hour from noon to 1
         * p.m. is hour 12.
         * <li>A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.
         * <li>A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and
         * 61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java
         * implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because
         * of the manner in which leap seconds are currently introduced, it is
         * extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same
         * minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions
         * for ISO C.
         * </ul>
         * <p>
         * In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need
         * not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be
         * specified as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1.

             * A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
             * number:<ul>
             * <li>If a number is preceded by <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> and a year
             * has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
             * offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
             * in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
             * expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
             * preceding <tt>-</tt> means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
             * are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,
             * <tt>-5</tt> occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
             * of Greenwich" and <tt>+0430</tt> would mean "four hours and
             * thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
             * string to specify <tt>GMT</tt>, <tt>UT</tt>, or <tt>UTC</tt>
             * redundantly-for example, <tt>GMT-5</tt> or <tt>utc+0430</tt>.
             * <li>The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
             * following conditions is true:
             * <ul>
             * <li>The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
             * space, comma, slash, or end of string
             * <li>The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
             * the month have already been recognized</li>
             * </ul>
             * If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
             * interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
             * which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
             * the time when the Date class is initialized.
             * After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
             * it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
             * the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
             * years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018.  Note
             * that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
             * years less than 100 that is used in {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat}.
             * <li>If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
             * unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
             * regarded as a minute.
             * <li>If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
             * (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range <tt>0</tt>
             * to <tt>11</tt>), unless a month has already been recognized, in
             * which case it is regarded as a day of the month.
             * <li>If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
             * end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
             * minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
             * been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
             * otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month. </ul><p>

             * as follows:<ul>
             * <li>A word that matches <tt>AM</tt>, ignoring case, is ignored (but
             * the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
